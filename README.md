### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my Github profile!
I' m a full-stack software engineer, with a Typescript main stack but having fun with Blockchain and Solidity.
I work in a [filecoin project](https://github.com/filecoin-project) called fil+.


I have fun at hackathons, and those are my latest open source projects:

ETHGlobal - [Space Warp(FVM Hack)]( https://github.com/fabriziogianni7/Smart-Notary-Protocol )

ETHLisbon - [Bacalhau Compute Over Data - ipfs video computation](https://github.com/rickkdev/ipfs-video-computation-bacalhau)

ETHGlobal - ETHAmsterdam [investment strategy backtester](https://github.com/fabriziogianni7/straEthgify)

Chainlink - [Chainlink 2022 Fall Hackathon ](https://github.com/ialberquilla/chainlink-technical-indicators) 



*My mission is to create something which could ease people life.*
