## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my Github profile!

I' m a full-stack software engineer, with a Typescript main stack but having fun with Blockchain and Solidity.

I work in a [filecoin project](https://github.com/filecoin-project) called fil+.


I have fun at hackathons, and those are my latest open source projects:
